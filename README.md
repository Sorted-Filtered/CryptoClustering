# CryptoClustering
## Module 19

### Project Description
This project uses cryptocurrency data and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to predict price volatility in 24-hour and 7-day time frames. 

### Execution
Run Crypto_Clustering.ipynb after cloning repo to your local machine. The analysis will populate in the output cells of that jupyter notebook file, as well as a breakdown of the data is included in the markdown cells. 

### Features
Jupyter Notebook installation is required to run the files (I used VSCode to create and run the file). Most modules used were from the sklearn library, including: KMeans, PCA, and StandardScaler. Pandas was also used, as well as panda's hvplot. 

### Contributors
EdX class code was used for the entire project.
